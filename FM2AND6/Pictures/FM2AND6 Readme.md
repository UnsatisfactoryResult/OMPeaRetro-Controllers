What is it, and what's it do?

The FM2AND6 is a custom controller built into a Saturn style shell designed for the Fujitsu FM Towns series of computers and Marty consoles. While it is specifically designed for FM Towns, 2 Button Mode is compatible with the following Japanese PC platforms as well:

NEC PC88
NEC PC98
MSX
Fujitsu FM-7
Sharp X68000

There are other platforms it may work on as well, but these particular series have been tested by myself and/or others. If an FM Towns controller works on it, then the FM2AND6 should work as well. A notable omission is the Sharp X1 series. I will be releasing an adapter to add compatibility at a later date.

6 Button Mode is specific to the FM Towns. A small handful of games make use of more than 2 buttons:

PuLiRuLa (3 buttons)
Blandia Plus (3 buttons)
Samurai Spirits (4 buttons) (Requires 4MB RAM and 486 CPU, not playable on Marty)
Fatal Fury (4 buttons) (Extremely rare and undumped as of right now, but word is that a dump is coming)
Super Street Fighter II (6 buttons) (Requires 4MB RAM, playable on Marty with RAM expansion and turning "Raster" off in menu)

----------------------------------------
What about other 6 button platforms?

The X68000 is the only other platform with some official games that make use of more than 2 buttons, but they did not release their own controller for this. Instead they relied on the game creators to release their own solutions. Magical Company released their own controller for use with Fatal Fury 2 and Special, and Capcom released an adapter to make use of the 6 button Genesis or SNES controllers. Chelnov also came with a small adapter for use with 3 button Genesis controllers. Because of this, the FM2AND6 can map more buttons than a 2 button controller, but it is not able to fully support this software.

How are the buttons laid out, and what's this Derek Mode?

There's a graphic in the pictures folder showing an overview of the modes. The center 2/6 Mode button is a latching pushbutton switch. In the up position 2 Button Mode is active, in the down position 6 Button Mode is active. Some games do not work properly with a 6 button controller, hence the need to be able to swap back and forth.

If you look at the layout graphic closely, you'll notice Derek Mode. This only affects 2 Button Mode, and it keeps the A Button on the left and the B Button on the right. The controller ships in Standard Mode. If you would prefer Derek Mode then you'll need to open the controller and press down the hidden pushbutton switch.

Who manufactures them, and where?

The PCBs and SMD assembly takes place overseas. I only select major brands such as Texas Instruments, Panasonic, Samsung, Rohm, etc. A 2U thick ENIG (gold) finish is used on the exposed copper for maximum corrosion resistance. 

Once I have all the parts on hand in the US, I solder on the cables, switches, and trigger button PCBs. Everything then gets cleaned of flux and any debris.

At this point we enter the testing and assembly phase. I partially assemble it so that I can test that Derek Mode functions properly. Everything gets fully assembled and tested in Standard Mode. If all is well, I apply the logos, and put it in its box.

There are a few modifications I make to the cases themselves prior to assembly at some point in the process. The testing is also to ensure these modifications are within my spec, and will be adjusted if needed.

I test one more time before I ship out for a triple sanity check.

Will it work on some really obscure platform that nobody has heard of in 40 years?

Possibly? Send me an email. There are some very unique controller setups out there on old Japanese PCs. The Sharp MZ-700 series and Sord M5 are pretty non-standard, for example. I do plan to add support where I can via plug in adapters, but this will take some time.

The Sharp X1 series and Sega SC3000/SG1000/SG1000 II/Master System are first on my list.

Will this work on Western computers like the TI 99/4A or Atari 2600?

No. I could make adapters for it, but I plan to offer a different solution for Western computers at a later time.
