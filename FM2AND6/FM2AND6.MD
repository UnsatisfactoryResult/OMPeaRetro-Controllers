## **What is it, and what's it do?**

The FM2AND6 is a custom controller built into a Saturn style shell designed for the Fujitsu FM Towns series of computers and Marty consoles. While it is specifically designed for FM Towns, 2 Button Mode is compatible with the following Japanese PC platforms as well:

**CONFIRMED**
* NEC PC6000 Series
* NEC PC88 Series (through 9 pin mouse port)
* NEC PC98 Series (through 9 pin mouse port, may require adapter, or soundcard with joystick ports)
* MSX/MSX2/MSX2+/MSX Turbo R Series
* Fujitsu FM-7 Series
* Sharp X68000 Series

**CONFIRMED BUT REQUIRE ADAPTER**
* Sharp X1 Series (available on OMPeaRetro.com)
* Tomy Pyuuta/Tutor Series (small numbers may be available on OMPeaRetro.com in the future)
* Sega SC3000/SG1000/Master System (available on OMPeaRetro.com)
* Toshiba Pasopia Series (requires JOYPAC2, XPAC2, or similar)

**UNCONFIRMED**
* National JR-200 (I own one, but need to repair and test)
* Sharp MZ-2500 Series
* Sony SMC-777 Series (I own one, but need to repair and test)
* Hitachi MB-S1/10AV (the only model in the series with built in joystick ports)
* Hino CEFUCOM-21 (Sanyo PHC-25 compatible with built in joystick ports)
* Sharp MZ-800 (European only successor to the MZ-700, dipswitch 1 = off, may require Sharp X1 adapter)

**UNCOMFIRMED AND COMPLICATED**
* Hitachi MB-S1 Series excluding the /10AV (require joystick interface card or MPC-PJ01 expansion)
* Sanyo PHC-25 (requires the PSG-01 expansion)
* Seiko MAP-1010 (Sanyo PHC-25 compatible, requires the MAP-1030 expansion)
* Philips/Radiola/Schneider VG5000Î¼ (released only in France, requires VG5200 or VG5216 expansions)

There are other platforms it may work on as well. If an FM Towns controller works on it then the FM2AND6 should work as well, and if an MSX controller works on it then the FM2AND6 might work on it. Systems marked **CONFIRMED** have been tested by myself or others. A big thanks to KTJDragon at KTJDragon.com for posting info about some of the more obscure systems on his site.

6 Button Mode is specific to the FM Towns. A small handful of games make use of more than 2 buttons:

* PuLiRuLa (3 buttons)
* Blandia Plus (3 buttons)
* Samurai Spirits (4 buttons) (Requires 4MB RAM and 486 CPU, not playable on Marty)
* Fatal Fury (4 buttons) (Extremely rare and undumped as of right now, but word is that a dump is coming)
* Super Street Fighter II (6 buttons) (Requires 4MB RAM, playable on Marty with RAM expansion and turning "Raster" off in menu)

------------------------------------
## **What about other 6 button platforms?**

The X68000 is the only other platform with some official games that make use of more than 2 buttons, but they did not release their own controller for this. Instead they relied on the game creators to release their own solutions. Magical Company released their own controller for use with Fatal Fury 2 and Special, and Capcom released an adapter to make use of the 6 button Genesis or SNES controllers. Chelnov also came with a small adapter for use with 3 button Genesis controllers. Because of this, the FM2AND6 can map more buttons than a 2 button controller, but it is not able to fully support this software.

----------------------------------
## **Why use a Saturn style controller?**

It's awesome! I was a Sega kid growing up, and the Japanese Saturn controller is definitely a top 3 controller for me. It also has the perfect amount of buttons I needed to create the FM2AND6. 

---------------------------------------------------------
## **How are the buttons laid out, and what's this Derek Mode?**

There's a graphic in the pictures folder showing an overview of the modes. The center 2/6 Mode button is a latching pushbutton switch. In the up position 2 Button Mode is active, in the down position 6 Button Mode is active. Some games do not work properly with a 6 button controller, hence the need to be able to swap back and forth.

If you look at the layout graphic closely, you'll notice Derek Mode. This only affects 2 Button Mode, and it keeps the A Button on the left and the B Button on the right. The controller ships in Standard Mode. If you would prefer Derek Mode then you'll need to open the controller and press down the hidden pushbutton switch.

---------------------------------
## **Who manufactures them, and where?**

The PCBs and SMD assembly takes place overseas. I only select major brands such as Texas Instruments, Panasonic, Samsung, Rohm, etc. A 2U thick ENIG (gold) finish is used on the exposed copper for maximum corrosion resistance. 

Once I have all the parts on hand in the US, I solder on the cables, switches, and trigger button PCBs. Everything then gets cleaned of flux and any debris.

At this point we enter the testing and assembly phase. I partially assemble it so that I can test that Derek Mode functions properly. Everything gets fully assembled and tested in Standard Mode. If all is well, I apply the logos, and put it in its box.

There are a few modifications I make to the cases themselves prior to assembly at some point in the process. The testing is also to ensure these modifications are within my spec, and will be adjusted if needed.

I test one more time before I ship out for a triple sanity check.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Will it work on some really obscure platform that nobody has heard of in 40 years?**

Possibly? Send me an email. There are some very unique controller setups out there on old Japanese PCs. The Sharp MZ-700 series and Sord M5 are pretty non-standard, for example. I do plan to add support where I can via plug in adapters, but this will take some time.

The Sharp X1 series and Sega SC3000/SG1000/SG1000 II/Master System are first on my list.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Will this work on Western computers like the TI 99/4A or Atari 2600?**

No. I could make adapters for it, but I plan to offer a different solution for Western computers at a later time.

----------------------------------
## **I don't need all of those buttons.**

I have a different controller in the prototype stage aimed more at the 2 button crowd. This, or something similar, will also be made for the Western PC users.

-------------------------------------
## **What about the X68000 6 button games?**

I have an X68000, Street Fighter 2 Dash with the Capcom adapter, and Fatal Fury 2 with the controller on order so I can research a solution.
